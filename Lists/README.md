# bookLists data

This folder should contain files listing the contents of a digital archive to be examined for entries which can be merged into `atcl-tei.xml` because they have matching magic key values.

A small example file, `vwwp-list.xml`, is provided, derived from the Victorian Women Writer's Project at Indiana University. Note that this list contains some titles which do not meet the ATCL criteria for inclusion, for example because they are verse rather than novels. 


Other files have to be generated by processing the metadata files provided by the relevant archive. Convertors for the files we have tested are included in the Scripts folder. these include the following:

 - `blConv.xsl` : operates on 
 - `htConv.xsl`
 - `gutConv.xsl`
 - `iaConv.xsl`
